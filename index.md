Favorite Labs and Reflection #1
Lab 2, part 1 wasnâ€™t super exciting but it helped me understand how to use basic commands like git add, git commit, and git push. It also helps students understand order of operations. I think this lab is a great introduction to familiarize myself with using Github and VisualStudioCode.

Favorite Labs and Reflection #2
Although it was hard, Lab 7 part 1 and 2 improved my use of if-statements. It was much more difficult compared to the other labs because we worked with multiple files between datediff.cc and datediff_functions.cc. It also helped me understand what arguments are and how they are used. 

Favorite Labs and Reflection #3
Lab 10, part 2 is one of my favorites because it helped me understand how loops work. The program had to loop through the vector to match the county with its population. It also taught me how to use 2D vectors.
